## Project Name
Qingdong_Chen_HW3_MUSIC-MIXER

## Installation
You just need to open it on your web page

## Usage
You can drag the button below to the wireframe above, and then music will play, and the music can be superimposed, and you can create your own rhythm. Whatâ€™s interesting is that you can also have some fun by sliding your mouse over the background. I designed it because I thought it looked rhythmic.
